      "{'question': \"I don't have a question...I just wanted to say thanks to everyone who posted in an earlier thread on this topic (https://community.ricksteves.com/travel-forum/turkey/stopover-in-istanbul-anybody-avail-themselves-of-this-turkish-airlines); posting here because that thread has been automatically closed due to inactivity.  To pay that help forward in some small measure, here's a brief report on my experience:\\nWe're visiting Istanbul in Feb.-Mar. 2025, starting in the US but stopping over in Istanbul for three nights on our return from Athens via Turkish Airlines.  I couldn't use the airline's web form for the stopover request because of the peculiarities of my reservation (my son was booked under a separate flight record; with economy air tickets, I qualified for only 2 nights but was staying 3 nights), but it was no problem to email the airline.  They sent me a form to fill out (actually a spreadsheet).  A post on the thread I referenced above lists the hotels available to economy-class travelers; I found two that were in the Old Town area we wanted, decided which of those we preferred and noted that in the form I filled out.  I received a pdf hotel voucher 10 days later with the hotel we wanted and then booked the third (final) night myself.  \\nThanks again, fellow travelers!\"}\n",
      "{'question': 'Next Oct 2025 we have a scheduled cruise on Norwegian with a stop in Kusadasi.  Some years ago we were in Izmir and did a very nice 6 hour excursion to Temple of Artemis, Ampiteater, House of Mary, rug weaver, etc.\\nHowever, NCL arrives at port 6:30 am and departs at 12:30 pm.  Needing time for port clearance, gangplank, etc. it appears there are only 3-4 hours to be off ship, not time to do much of any shore excursion.  In fact, NCL does not even have excursions listed for Kusadasi as the rep thought the limited time was the reason for this.  Other port stops have dozens of shore excursions listed.\\nNCL said the old town streets are very nice and an easy walk from the pier.  Anybody have thoughts on having just 3-4 hours in Kusadasi?  \\nThank you.    Ted', 'answer1': \"I was in Kusadasi two months ago as part of a land trip. \\nKusadasi is definitely worth visiting and colorful, even for just three to four hours. Except Istanbul, Kusadasi had the best bazaar of the six towns I visited. It's worth strolling through the town center, where you could get a drink and-or snack. The bazaar is composed of a maze of at least a dozen or more streets. There is a historic caravanserai (https://explorekusadasi.com/okuz-mehmed-pasha-caravanserai/) right next to the bazaar. \\nI saw the Ephesus site as part of my stay and adored it. You'd be running through Ephesus if you want to see it again, but it's doable. Unless you're dead set for a return visit, I wouldn't go all the way to Ephesus because it deserves an entire day.\", 'answer2': \"I'm kind of surprised they don't give you more time given the draw of Ephesus. Lucky you have been before as you definitely won't have time to go and see it properly. Kusadasi port is very close to the bazaar and caravanserai, though much of what you will see is high end stores targeted at the cruise crowds. I enjoyed a nice walk out to the castle (just to the south of the port). The RS guidebook for Istanbul contains a short entry for Kusadasi with suggested restaurants and sites.\", 'answer3': \"I prefer to go by plane rather than by ship. Last year we went late so our time was very limited and we couldn't see all the places comfortably.\", 'answer4': \"We just booked the same cruise (following RS's 7 days walking tour of  Istanbul) and saw they offer several excursions to view Ephesus while in Kusadasi.\"}\n",
      "{'question': 'Arriving IST in the a.m.   Then flying to Athens on Aegean air the same day.  How long and how far to get from IST to the terminal for Aegean airlines? \\nThanks,', 'answer1': 'I dont understand your question. Aegean flies out of IST. IST has 4 concourses. How long your connection takes will depend on many factors. Are both legs on one ticket or separate? Will you have checked luggage? What time are you scheduled to arrive/depart? Then other factors: how long is the line for passport control? If you are on separate tickets and have checked luggage, you will have to exit the secure area, pick up your luggage and check it with Aegean, then go through security to go to your next gate. If you are on a single ticket , or are on separate tickets but only carryon luggage, and have your boarding pass for your connecting flight, then you should be able to stay airside and proceed to your gate after Passport Control. Display boards will show which concourse and gate you need.', 'answer2': \"A few points of clarification from the previous response:\\nIST has five concourses, not four. (A, B, D, F, and G). There are also C gates and E gates, but they are along a corridor that spans the airport terminal, not a separate concourse. You can see the map of the terminal at https://inmapper.com/istanbul-airport/.\\nYou will not have to go through passport control if you already have your boarding pass for your connecting flight. Follow the signs for international transfers. You'll go through a security screening and that will dump you into the main terminal.\\nOccasionally I have been allowed to bypass the international transfer gate at IST and proceed directly to the main terminal, but I think it depends where your flight originated, and I think coming from the US, you won't have that option.\\nIf you don't have your Aegean boarding pass, you may have to go through passport control and check in again, so you should really try to get it. If you can't get it before you leave the US, perhaps you can connect to airport WiFi after you land and check in for your flight.\\nIn any case, it's a large airport, and you'll have to do a lot of walking. But the signage is excellent and it's quite efficient. There's no straightforward answer to how much time you'll need. How much time do you have???\", 'answer3': 'thank you.  you provided information that is very helpful.  I do appreciate it!!'}\n",
      "{'question': 'Hello friends!\\nNow here is a question that has never been asked before: how do you get from Istanbul Airport (IST) to Sultanahmet? \\nI am joking - the question has been asked many times, and I have done my research. However, I am none the wiser for it. My hotel is close to Eminonu. I am elderly but in very good shape and am traveling light. I\\'ve considered taking a taxi from the airport as it\\'s the easiest option, but Istanbul cabbies seem to have a bad reputation, and I don\\'t want to end up being taken on a detour through the Asian part of Istanbul! \\nI have considered the Havaist (airport bus) option, but the bus seems to drop off its \"cargo\" at the Aksaray metro station, which means I will then have to take a tram. I am alert and with it, but I am not sure I want to be figuring all this out after a long-haul flight.\\nFinally, the metro! This seems like the best option, cost- and efficiency-wise. Take the M11 line to Gayrettepe, then switch to the M2 line and get off at Halic. Halic looks like it\\'s in the middle of a bridge, and it\\'s just a mile-long walk from there to Eminonu, which is doable. Like I said, I am in good shape and will be traveling light. However, I keep on reading that the metro switch from M11 to M2 at Gayrettepe is a nightmare - there is a very long walk, and the signage is poor. On top of that, I apparently need an Istanbul card of some kind (\"Istanbul Kart), which I need to buy at the airport.\\nSo I am scratching my head at this point. Any ideas from those who have been through all this?', 'answer1': 'My recent Istanbul hotel was at the other end of the Galata Bridge from Eminonu. I decided on a private transfer, which I arranged through my hotel. By far, the most expensive option - but I could arrange all the planning ahead of time.\\nHopefully, CL will tell you about Welcome Pickups, a less expensive private transfer, which I would have used except that I am currently allergic to anything except fully refundable.\\nOn top of that, I apparently need an Istanbul card of some kind (\"Istanbul Kart\")\\nI can give you good news there. Istanbul transit now takes tap credit cards and Google/Apple pay on your phone. So there is no need to buy the IstanbulKart, unless you want it for the savings. Here\\'s a recent thread with details:\\nhttps://community.ricksteves.com/travel-forum/turkey/istanbul-kart-worth-it', 'answer2': 'Thanks for the good news, CWsocial! I did NOT know that.\\nAs for the private transfer option, I have considered that as well. The problem is that I have a tight connection on the way to Istanbul, and if I miss the flight to Istanbul, I will lose money - my understanding is that Welcome Pickups is non-refundable.', 'answer3': \"That is another reason that I went with my hotel transfer. Their process is an assembly line of arrivals. There are greeters at the airport. When you arrive, they check your name and connect you with an available driver. (It doesn't look that organized at their meeting point, but it does seem to work.)\\nI've only ever arranged it through my hotel, so I don't know the name of the service. But I can WhatsApp my hotel and ask them. I know it is not specific to my hotel.\\nThe cost to my Karakoy hotel (across the bridge from Eminonu) was $110 for both directions. And they wanted American cash, which I paid to my hotel, not the driver. I think it would have been $60 one way. Undoubtedly, the most expensive option.\", 'answer4': \"Hi CWsocial,\\nRe your last message, I am not sure I am following. Did you make the arrangements on the spot (at the airport)? If you do arrange for the private transfer in advance, and you miss the connecting flight, then it won't work? Am I missing something?\", 'answer5': \"I indeed used Welcome Pickups and it worked great for me, approx. $45 US one way. I had direct communication with the driver via the WP app and also Whatsapp (the driver's preferred communication). My flight was somewhat delayed and he was keeping an eye on it, I assume I could have contacted him if I had missed my connection and informed him of that. Poking around on the Welcome Pickups site, it does look like you can contact their customer support via their app, they could potentially make an exception if you contacted them quickly. https://support.welcomepickups.com/en/articles/4698582-how-can-i-make-changes-to-my-booked-transfer   Will note that not everyone has been satisfied with WP, as pointed out in this recent post.\\nhttps://community.ricksteves.com/travel-forum/turkey/shuttle-from-ist-to-city-senter \\nThere is a taxi stand at the airport and plenty of people use that option every day. There are different service classes with different rates - just make sure to confirm the anticipated price before you get in and that they accept your payment preference (card or cash). https://www.istairport.com/en/airport/airport-transportation/urban-transportation/other/?locale=en\\nI also explored all the public transit options and decided I would just be too tired to figure them out on arrival. I do think having a door-to-door shuttle made it easier for me to settle in to a bustling Istanbul. On a second trip I would probably use transit as I am now familiar with how it works and how busy the trams can get in the historic area.\", 'answer6': \"Did you make the arrangements on the spot (at the airport)?\\nI made the arrangements in advance, giving my hotel the flight details. \\nIf you do arrange for the private transfer in advance, and you miss the connecting flight, then it won't work?\\nIt seems to be a full time and ongoing operation at the airport. The driver isn't immediately waiting for you, just these greeters. When you arrive at the meeting point, the greeters contact the driver. You wait, with other passengers, until your ride pulls up. I might have waited 15 or 20 minutes.\\nI didn't have a connection and didn't ask whether there was any limit on how long they would wait.\", 'answer7': 'The convenient and easy-to-use Havaist Airport Bus—for less than $3 will drop you off at the Beyazit stop about 1-2 miles from Sultanahmet.  From the bus stop at Beyazit It’s easy to catch a taxi to your hotel.', 'answer8': '\"t seems to be a full time and ongoing operation at the airport. The driver isn\\'t immediately waiting for you, just these greeters.\"\\nI believe this is because taxi drivers are not allowed to be in the arrivals hall, based on what I have read.\\nThanks, folks! I think I have it figured out now.', 'answer9': 'Instead of getting lost to find a taxi or Uber , it is better to us HAVAIST .', 'answer10': \"I just returned from a wonderful trip to Istanbul.  I used Istanbul Shuttle Port. I booked ahead of time online and included the tip in the price. I chose the option to pay the driver. The directions were easy to follow for pick up at airport and they picked us up at our hotel on the return. Fantastic service on time and inexpensive in my opinion.  I have made the mistake of taking the metro ect., to save a few bucks and it is not worth it! Trams in Istanbul especially can be packed. Trying to get on with luggage no thank you. Then factor in jet lag it's a nightmare.  Just get a Shuttle.\", 'answer11': \"We are having our first visit to Istanbul at the end of October and are staying at the Wings Hotel.\\nI just looked up their costs for a transfer and it is 110 Euro each way.  These seems extremely high, or is it?\\nI certainly don't want to be carting luggage on a metro in a strange city, and I also don't like prepaying a transfer in case something goes wrong.\\nIs our hotel ripping us off?\", 'answer12': 'Yes, your hotel is ripping you off.  Look elsewhere.  I used welcome pickups, but other options like bus will work well too.', 'answer13': 'Is our hotel ripping us off?\\nMy hotel charged $60 for one way and $110 total for both directions. My hotel is a 1 minute walk from the Wings Hotel. So for $110, I would expect round trip. \\nETA: and mine was dollars, not euros.\\nThe Wings Hotel looks great by the way. Its neon green sign is visible from the Bosphorus. I used it as a marker to locate my own hotel.', 'answer14': 'I used Welcome Pickups for a group of five and it was great. I have the app on my phone, and the driver sent his photo, and instructions, with photos, of how to get to where he was waiting. He knew when our flight had landed, and called me on WhatsApp to make sure we were on the right path, and I was able to tell him we would be a few minutes as one of our group was missing a bag. The car was very nice, and the price, split five ways, was only 10 euros each. I first used them in Athens a couple years ago when I was by myself, and had a similarly good experience.', 'answer15': \"As I mentioned in an earlier post I used Istanbul Shuttle Port. I should have included the cost:\\nFrom airport to Sultahament for 7 people 75 euros with tip. The return trip was only 5 of us for 45 euros with tip. An excellent price. I've traveled all over Europe and this is an excellent price.\", 'answer16': \"Most costs in Istanbul are significantly lower than in countries to the west.  \\nThere are several factors complicating the issue of airport transportation in Istanbul:\\n\\nUnlike some other major cities, Istanbul doesn't have fixed taxi fares to the airport.\\nTraffic in the city can descend into gridlock, making the meter fare more variable than one might expect.  Drivers don't want to eat the cost of sitting in standstill traffic without compensation, and visitors aren't comfortable with the circuitous routes that may actually be the fastest because they suspect they are being employed as a means to run up the meter.  \\nEnglish and other European languages are not necessarily well spoken by the taxi drivers (this varies, of course).  This tends to make visitors, especially first-time visitors, uncertain about just stepping into a taxi.  It's probably uncomfortable for the drivers, too; they know they may not be able to explain the traffic challenges in the city.  \\nOne result of the above is an apparent driver preference for negotiated fares rather than use of the meter.  There are fewer arguments that way.  \\n\\nWhen I was in Istanbul in Sep-Oct 2023, I saw in the elevator of one of my hotels (not a 5-star luxury place) a sign offering airport transportation for somewhere between 30 and 35 euros.  I remember thinking at the time that was a smidgen higher than I'd expect to pay a taxi driver (the typical hotel overcharge), but I didn't take a taxi between the airport and the city center--I was reacting to what I had read while doing pre-trip research.  There definitely seems to be rather wide variation in what one pays for an airport run in Istanbul.\\nTurkiye suffers from significant inflation, but the lira is week against the dollar and euro, so I don't know that there's been much change in the euro cost of airport transportation since the fall of 2023.  I certainly wouldn't sign up for a 100-euro or 75-euro deal unless a special vehicle like a 12-passenger van was required.  But then I don't really attach extra value to a fancy vehicle or someone holding up a sign with my name on it; I'd rather just go to the taxi queue so I don't have to worry about whether the driver will wait if my flight is late, etc.\"}\n"
