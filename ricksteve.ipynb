Ted', 'answer': \"I was in Kusadasi two months ago as part of a land trip. \\nKusadasi is definitely worth visiting and colorful, even for just three to four hours. Except Istanbul, Kusadasi had the best bazaar of the six towns I visited. It's worth strolling through the town center, where you could get a drink and-or snack. The bazaar is composed of a maze of at least a dozen or more streets. There is a historic caravanserai (https://explorekusadasi.com/okuz-mehmed-pasha-caravanserai/) right next to the bazaar. \\nI saw the Ephesus site as part of my stay and adored it. You'd be running through Ephesus if you want to see it again, but it's doable. Unless you're dead set for a return visit, I wouldn't go all the way to Ephesus because it deserves an entire day.\"}\n",

      "{'question': 'Arriving IST in the a.m.   Then flying to Athens on Aegean air the same day.  How long and how far to get from IST to the terminal for Aegean airlines? \\nThanks,', 'answer': 'I dont understand your question. Aegean flies out of IST. IST has 4 concourses. How long your connection takes will depend on many factors. Are both legs on one ticket or separate? Will you have checked luggage? What time are you scheduled to arrive/depart? Then other factors: how long is the line for passport control? If you are on separate tickets and have checked luggage, you will have to exit the secure area, pick up your luggage and check it with Aegean, then go through security to go to your next gate. If you are on a single ticket , or are on separate tickets but only carryon luggage, and have your boarding pass for your connecting flight, then you should be able to stay airside and proceed to your gate after Passport Control. Display boards will show which concourse and gate you need.'}\n",
      "{'question': 'Arriving IST in the a.m.   Then flying to Athens on Aegean air the same day.  How long and how far to get from IST to the terminal for Aegean airlines? \\nThanks,', 'answer': \"A few points of clarification from the previous response:\\nIST has five concourses, not four. (A, B, D, F, and G). There are also C gates and E gates, but they are along a corridor that spans the airport terminal, not a separate concourse. You can see the map of the terminal at https://inmapper.com/istanbul-airport/.\\nYou will not have to go through passport control if you already have your boarding pass for your connecting flight. Follow the signs for international transfers. You'll go through a security screening and that will dump you into the main terminal.\\nOccasionally I have been allowed to bypass the international transfer gate at IST and proceed directly to the main terminal, but I think it depends where your flight originated, and I think coming from the US, you won't have that option.\\nIf you don't have your Aegean boarding pass, you may have to go through passport control and check in again, so you should really try to get it. If you can't get it before you leave the US, perhaps you can connect to airport WiFi after you land and check in for your flight.\\nIn any case, it's a large airport, and you'll have to do a lot of walking. But the signage is excellent and it's quite efficient. There's no straightforward answer to how much time you'll need. How much time do you have???\"}\n",

Any ideas from those who have been through all this?', 'answer': \"Most costs in Istanbul are significantly lower than in countries to the west.  \\nThere are several factors complicating the issue of airport transportation in Istanbul:\\n\\nUnlike some other major cities, Istanbul doesn't have fixed taxi fares to the airport.\\nTraffic in the city can descend into gridlock, making the meter fare more variable than one might expect.  Drivers don't want to eat the cost of sitting in standstill traffic without compensation, and visitors aren't comfortable with the circuitous routes that may actually be the fastest because they suspect they are being employed as a means to run up the meter.  \\nEnglish and other European languages are not necessarily well spoken by the taxi drivers (this varies, of course).  This tends to make visitors, especially first-time visitors, uncertain about just stepping into a taxi.  It's probably uncomfortable for the drivers, too; they know they may not be able to explain the traffic challenges in the city.  \\nOne result of the above is an apparent driver preference for negotiated fares rather than use of the meter.  There are fewer arguments that way.  \\n\\nWhen I was in Istanbul in Sep-Oct 2023, I saw in the elevator of one of my hotels (not a 5-star luxury place) a sign offering airport transportation for somewhere between 30 and 35 euros.  I remember thinking at the time that was a smidgen higher than I'd expect to pay a taxi driver (the typical hotel overcharge), but I didn't take a taxi between the airport and the city center--I was reacting to what I had read while doing pre-trip research.  There definitely seems to be rather wide variation in what one pays for an airport run in Istanbul.\\nTurkiye suffers from significant inflation, but the lira is week against the dollar and euro, so I don't know that there's been much change in the euro cost of airport transportation since the fall of 2023.  I certainly wouldn't sign up for a 100-euro or 75-euro deal unless a special vehicle like a 12-passenger van was required.  But then I don't really attach extra value to a fancy vehicle or someone holding up a sign with my name on it; I'd rather just go to the taxi queue so I don't have to worry about whether the driver will wait if my flight is late, etc.\"}\n",

Any recent visits to confirm/deny ?', 'answer': \"Geography is one of the main reasons I'm leery about big-city sightseeing passes.  I think it's difficult to grasp how much of the pass running time might be spent just traveling from one place to the next.\\nAnother thing to consider is how much of the visitor's time will be spent seeing free attractions or just walking around, experiencing the city.  Just as London has many large, wonderful museums that are free, Istanbul is full of interesting mosques, most of which are free to visit (though a donation is nice), and picturesque neighborhoods.\"}\n",
