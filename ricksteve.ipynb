I hope people who have taken the tour or travelled on similar routes in Turkey can share their experience/advice regarding the arrival and departure times and airports. I am thinking:\\n1. Fly in Istanbul (IST) and out of Izmir (ADB). The problem for me is that the departure flight from ADB is 10:50am so I am not sure I can make it on the same day the trip is over. Should I book the flight for the following day to be safe? If so, where should I stay overnight? Izmir, or Kusadasi? If Izmir, the tour will provide the transportation on the last day of the tour. Is it easy to get to Izmir from Kudadasi on my own? Considering the departure time of my flight, I probably should stay overnight at Izmir, but I read a post on this forum which says she/he made it to the 10:45am flight when they arrived at the airport at 9:00am.\\n2. Take a ferry to Samos and then to Athens (ATH) and fly back home from ATH. The flights are cheater and get to see Greece a little. I can have 3-5 days to explore Samos and Athens, but I definitely will want to visit Greece separately in the future. So as I am typing, I am thinking perhaps this is not a good idea?\\n3. How many days in advance should I arrive in Istanbul? Is one day too risky (in case of flight cancellation)?\\n4. How easily to get to the (Demiray) hotel from the airport? I want to reserve the shuttle services which the hotel provides but I don't know if it's refundable if I cancel my hotel reservation.\\n5. Can anybody familiar with Turkish Airline flight classes and change and cancellation policies chime in: Is Extrafly the equivalent of Economy? But unlike the economy with US airlines, it appears that after the 24-hour window, there is no way to get a refund or a flight credit. The only option is to change flights after paying $70.

Everything from not so great accommodations to not a great guide, and having to pay out of pocket for tips and extras. I have looked at other tour company websites that also require tour members have US dollars on them for a variety of things. Is there a company in a similar price range to RS that will not require this?', 'answer1': \"I have done 13 programs with Road Scholar although I have not been to Turkey with them. They have a similar model to Rick's where there is no tipping, it's included in the price. Although you always get some who insist on publicly tipping the guide and others who want to start a collection but I usually squash that idea and remind them that Road Scholar states tipping is included.\\nI'm on a couple of FB pages for Road Scholar (Women of Road Scholar and Friends of Road Scholar) which you might want to join. There have been some posts about trips to Turkey so you might get some information there from people who have actually gone.\", 'answer2': 'Thanks for the suggestion Pam. I looked at their Turkey tour, and I like the itinerary, but it is almost twice the price of RS. In Canadian dollars, that’s pretty significant. Still, might be worth saving for.', 'answer3': \"Oh yikes...that is a LOT of difference! Road Sch does have more meals than Rick's tours provide BUT not enough to be twice the price!\", 'answer4': 'You could look at tours by Odysseys Unlimited or Gate One (be sure to look at Gate One’s “small group” or “ discovery” tours that are limited to 22 people and include almost everything. Their “classic” and other tours can have as many as 40 people and often have a lot of optional tours that must be paid for separately.) Unfortunately, almost all tour companies besides Rick require tipping, but I’ve never had a guide who wasn’t perfectly happy to accept local currency, easily obtainable from an ATM. My experience with optional tours was that the company accepted credit cards. I’ve never had a tour “require” me to have large amounts of US cash. In fact, I’ve rarely used US cash in my travels to some 38 countries. The exceptions were Cambodia and Ecuador where they use US dollars as their currency.\\nHowever, don’t get too discouraged about the waitlist. It’s not unusual for people to drop out just before the final payment is due (60 days before the tour begins). You might want to ask RS where you are on the waitlist - if you’re number one, there may be hope. If you’re a much higher number, maybe not.', 'answer5': 'My first trip to Turkey was with Smithsonian/Odysseys. (Smithsonian tours to Turkey are basically rebadged Odysseys tours. The itinerary and accommodations are identical.) Smithsonian includes all tips, except for the gulet cruise, in the price. (There is some kind of cultural thing about not including the gulet tips.) I am not sure whether Odysseys has the same policy.\\nAnyhow, the itinerary was perfect. A representative from Odysseys, who called with a question about our sleeping arrangements shortly before the trip, told me that the Odysseys tour of Turkey is one of the crown jewels of their offerings. Evidently, the Turkey tour was the first tour the company offered, and the president of the company still takes the tour once a year. The itinerary and activities have been honed over decades.\\nOur tour guide was hands down the best tour guide I have ever had on a tour. (Sadly, he had to move to the US after the 2016 coup attempt in Turkey.)\\nThe accommodations were all first rate. If anything, they may have been a bit more high end than I would have preferred.\\nMy neighbors took a G-Adventures tour to Turkey last year, and they enjoyed it. The accommodations are definitely at the lower end, and a lot of the meals are on your own. I think that G-Adventures is very good if you want to experience more of a local flavor, and approach the tour with a sense of independence and adventure.', 'answer6': 'Thanks Renee, I don’t think I have looked at Gate 1 before. They have a Turkish treasures tour that looks similar to RS. The difference is that you do pay extra for several optional activities, and that puts the price up by about $700, putting it in a similar price range to RS. Might be worth a closer look.', 'answer7': \"Hi Anita - I just returned from an Overseas Adventure Travel (OAT) tour of Turkey 2 days ago and just loved it. It is slightly longer than the RS tour and includes 3 nights in Istanbul, 3 nights in Cappadocia (we were in Ugurp), 3 nights in Antayla, 4 nights on a gulet which motors along the mountainous Mediterranean coast, dropping anchor in bays with turquoise water. We had daily trips ashore via dinghy for some hiking (not too strenuous) to see ruins, visited a nomad family, explored an abandoned village Karakoy, etc. And 2 nights in Kusadasi. Price also includes 2 internal flights - from Istanbul to Kayseri (Cappadocia region) and from Izmir to Istanbul at end of the tour. Group limited to 14 because of the number of cabins on the gulet. Hotels were well situated. Travelers were slightly older and less fit compared to the 3 RS tours I have been on. Great guide. Tipping of guide done at end of the trip. Once outside of Istanbul, we traveled on a full sized bus. Optional balloon ride was $300 extra but so worth it. If you book early enough you can get a 'solo' spot (meaning room to yourself) without paying a supplement. Make sure if you are comparing prices that you indicate that you don't want to include airfare in the quoted price. Oh, I just checked their website and the solo spots are pretty much booked up for 2024 and 2025.\", 'answer8': 'Sloo, that sounds like a wonderful trip! I will take a look at the website and if things don’t work out this year maybe I will use them in the future.\\nOne of my concerns with waiting for someone to cancel just two months before is that I may pay a lot more for airfare, and I might not be able to book extra nights in the hotel pre-trip. So I’m not really sure how long to wait before making other plans. When I last emailed RS I was told that if a spot opens up they email everyone on the list, but would try to contact me first. No guarantee. The last spot on the tour was booked end of December, and I added myself to the waitlist two weeks later so I might be the first one on the list, but they don’t seem to go in order.', 'answer9': \"When I went to Turkey in 2022 I worked with Turkey Insiders (https://turkeyinsiders.com/).

They do have some packaged itineraries, but you can use those as a starting point and they'll work with you to customize the exact itinerary you want.\\nIf you're interested in knowing more, send me a PM. I can give you all the details about my itinerary, but it's too much to include in this post.\\nI've also done a number of OAT tours, though not their Turkey tour, but I would definitely recommend them as well.\", 'answer10': 'Thanks Lane, that’s a good site. There is some great information on the top sight etc. They do have a couple of longer tours, but they don’t list prices. I might email them as I am curious how their prices compare to other companies since they are based in Turkey. They also don’t mention the size of group.', 'answer11': \"Anita, they don't do group tours. They put together custom itineraries. Then each day, you might have a tour with a small group. You won't be with the same tour group the entire time. (I did share three tours with the same couple, and we became good friends by the end.) The smallest tour I had was three (that couple plus me); the biggest was about 12 (group van tour from Kusadasi to Pamukkale). And they don't list prices because everything is custom. But I found them to be extremely reasonable.\", 'answer12': 'I have done a couple of G Adventures. I usually do the National Geographic ones which have better hotels that are well located and top guides are used on these. For tips, I’ve often just contributed a sum to a kitty and the guide takes care of it all and the tip for the main guide is at your discretion.\\nMany companies have optional extras or don’t inline every meal because it allows for more flexibility and for everyone’s budgets. If you don’t want a meal, you aren’t losing on something you already paid for.\\nI’ve also used Exodus travels and really like them. The tours are smaller group the RS. I spent a week in a villa in the Italian countryside on one walking through untouristed towns an jour one so outside Venice. It was fabulous.', 'answer13': 'Thanks for clarifying that, Lane, so when I see a 15 day tour they are just putting together several short tours in a row.

I have been holding off on making other travel plans, hoping a spot would open on the Turkey tour I’m waitlisted for.

I was so excited, and quickly clicked the link to book the tour only to get a message saying it was full!!. Thinking it might be a mistake, I called RS tour office and explained. She checked and confirmed it was full. I told her I had been advised that I would be prioritized (I have been on the waitlist since mid Jan.).

That would eliminate (for me) Uskudar and Kadikoy from Cat Lady's list. On my recent trip to Istanbul I headed north of the Golden Horn on many occasions, and I noticed a lot of attractive areas up that way. The combination of historic architecture and gentrification was appealing from a tourist perspective.\\nHowever, I want to say that I would not do what you are planning. I'd split the time between one location south of the Golden Horn, not too far from Topkapi and Sultanahmet, and one to the north. That's what I did (roughly 10 days and 10 days, though for your purposes having more time to the north might be better), and I was glad I had done so. Being south of the Golden Horn would be more convenient for a lot of the traditional sightseeing you'll probably want to do. It will save you a lot of back-and-forth travel time. But it's a rather intense environment (especially west of Topkapi), so I wouldn't have wanted to stay there the whole time. During my ten days there I knocked off a lot of museums and mosques. After I relocated to the north, I focused more on visiting picturesque neighborhoods, in addition to going to museums not located in the Old City. There's so much to do in Istanbul that, aside from one ferry trip up the Bosphorus, I only got over to the Asian side one time. On that day I walked around the area southeast of the Uskudar ferry dock and (farther north) the very cute Kuzguncuk neighborhood.\\nIstanbul is extremely hilly; some streets turn into steps, not always with hand railings. Turkey has a four-season climate, with the average December experiencing 2 to 3 snowy days. I'd want to consider the terrain and pavement in selecting a place for a long stay. I'd hope to be able to walk from my lodging to the nearest Metro station and bus stops without dealing with troublesome cobblestones.\\nThere's lots of public transportation available in Istanbul, but the pieces don't always fit together seamlessly, so you'll find CityMapper sometimes suggesting routings with 3 or 4 legs. It may help you to know that CityMapper and Google, when offering routing suggestions for pedestrians, seem to ignore the funiculars. Learn where those are so you can employ them when suitable. Most of the time you pay for each transit leg separately. Tickets are cheap (generally TL 15 at the time of my visit except for some ferries), but it means keeping more money on your transit card (IstanbulKart) than you might anticipate needing. I found the vending machines for reloading cards sometimes tricky to use, so I was happy to add a good bit of value when I found one that worked. I had better luck using cash (no large notes) rather than a credit card; only some machines take cards.\\nYou shouldn't drink or brush your teeth with tap water in Istanbul, so be sure there's at least a little market close to your lodging.

Here is my humble first-timer advice.\\nSkip the Blue Mosque as it was under renovation, and much of the inside couldn't be seen (this advice came from our private tour guide and another person who went there on that day.) I didn't go, based on our guide's advice.\\nWe started out at Topkapi Palace, which was interesting and the lines weren't too long. We had lunch at a small cafeteria restaurant not far from the square and then proceeded to Hagia Sophia, where the line was very long. Don't get too discouraged as they stop it at times for private prayer, and it looks like the line isn't moving. But, when it opens, the line moves smoothly. It is worth the wait.\\nWe then went to the Grand Bazaar, which is interesting, but really, it is just a bunch of shops in a dizzying array of alleys. The Hippodrome is now just a park. I've been to the more authentic looking one in Caesarea Maritima, so this was really unexciting.\\nThe problems occurred on our way back to the ship. The traffic was gridlocked as we approached the bridge. With little time to make it back, the guide and group decided to get out in the middle of the street and walk back to port. It was a frantic walk, and we made it, but of course, I knew the ship tours were behind us, so the ship wouldn't leave. In fact, the ship left 90 mins late. My understanding is that the ship tours were much worse, losing people and many stories of disappointment.\\nThe crew seemed to know about the difficulties of traffic, so they took the tram. Get good instructions on how to do this, and just go to Istanbul on your own. The tram moved about smoothly while the buses, vans, and taxis were locked in the traffic to port. Our ship was only half full and the other ship was smaller.

I copied and pasted from that website:\\n“With Museum Pass İstanbul, you can visit more than three hundred museums and archaeological sites that belong to Republic of Turkey Ministry of Culture and Tourism for 5 days and enjoy your trip through time. The price of Museum Pass İstanbul which is valid for five days starting from your first museum and archaeological site entrance is 220 TL.”\\nAt Hagia Sofia, I highly suggest hiring a tour guide. The official price in March 2019 was 200 TL for taking you through and explaining everything. I think it is very informative to have a guide. There are guides at the entrance, but not all speak English very well. I strongly recommend hiring the guide we used: his name is Metin. His cell number is +90 (533) 322 00 85 If you have WhatsApp, you can message him for free using WhatsApp. Metin speaks English perfectly, he really knows history, and he is funny. You should consider hiring Metin to take you to other attractions in Istanbul.', 'answer2': \"Museum Pass, as previous poster stated, and gave the web address.\\nI bought mine at Hagia Sophia, very easy, signage clear, clerks selling the Pass spoke English. Remember your passport. The pass is tied to you and cannot be used by others. How they check that, I don't know. It saves time at every location because you skip the line-ups of people buying individual tickets. If you visit 3 or 4 major locations the cost is covered. It is very worth it.\\nChora church is amazing because of the tile work that covers so much of the ceilings. Breathtaking. It is a little hard to get to, if time is tight, use a taxi. Hagia Sophia is amazing because of its' size and volume and architectural and engineering aspects. Do look for the graffiti left by a Viking.\\nEnjoy these amazing sites, Harvey\", 'title': 'Museum card Istanbul'}. Error: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 3 column 163 (char 250)\n",

Thanks!', 'answer1': 'If they have HAVAS buses running to that airport from the Old City, definitely take one. I was under the impression that they ran from Taksim Square, so I would confirm that. I would not hesitate to take any bus in Istanbul, I took a few local buses as well.', 'answer2': \"There is but the directions sound so confusing and we get in after dark.

I'm concerned about not getting it right.

Either you take a 17 TL taxi ride after reaching Taksim Square (see option above), or you combine another airport shuttle line with a ferry ride, followed by a small taxi or tram ride as I’ll explain now.\\nFirst, hop on the Havabus heading for Kadıköy. The buses operate daily between 04:00 and 01:00. The ride costs 14 TL per person (luggage included) and takes approximately 60 minutes. In Kadıköy, walk to the Şehir Hatları dock and board the ferry to Eminönü. You can find the operating hours here. The ferry ride (with a nice view) takes about 15 minutes and costs 3 TL per person.If your hotel is in Eminönü, you can walk from there. If not you, must either take a small taxi ride (5 minutes maximum) or take the T1 Kabataş/Eminönü-Bağcılar tram in the direction of Bağçılar, and get off only a few stops later in Sultanahmet.\", 'answer3': 'I see a roundtrip private taxi (kiwitaxi) for 81 euro.

The ferry is really inexpensive and I loved the food markets/stalls and restaurants in Kadikoy (look up Ciya Sofrasi via Google, it's a real interesting place).

There are plenty of hotels in the $100 per night range such as the Conrad, Hilton, Marmara Taksim, but not sure which is the best bang for the buck. While I like the Conrad in particular, I have a feeling it's kind of isolated and only practical with lots of working+bus+tram rides.\\nI am more into sightseeing palaces, mosques, monuments than shopping/nightlife so don't find it absolutely necessary to stay in the center of things (Taksim, Istiklal) but don't want to be isolated.\\nAny input would be greatly appreciated.\", 'answer1': 'Not far from the definitely not 4 star hotel we stayed at, was the Four Seasons, which looked very 4 star-ish.

It doesn't have a hammam but there are plenty of stand-alone hammams in the city. Ortakoy to the north has some neat boutique hotels too (you can find them on www.booking.com). I also really enjoyed the local, non-touristy character of the Asia neighborhoods as well, such as Kadikoy. There are thousands of hotels in Istanbul, you should have no trouble finding a nice place.

First, cruise lines generally keep up-to-date on what's happening and if there's a serious threat somewhere, they adjust their port stops. A few years ago there was a little war in the north of Israel. The ship was scheduled to spend one night in the northern Med port and one in the south. They simply docked 2 nights in the southern port. Tel Aviv and Jerusalem weren't affected by the fighting and tourists had plenty of great sightseeing options. Second, as you may have already inferred, life continues (or resumes) normally and most residents and tourists are not affected at all. That doesn't mean there aren't risks. It does mean that you are more likely than not to have a great trip.\\nBTW I'm flying home to Tel Aviv on Turkish Air - connecting in Istanbul on August 18.\", 'answer32': \"Hi, Gail.

We saw a couple of police patrolling near the Blue Mosque and at the Spice Market people entering were wanded...good to see it actually. People are friendly and helpful. We thought perhaps there would be some resentment towards Americans about the Gulen issue but this has not been the case. Our waiter tonight was very open about his hatred of Erdoğan and said most people feel the same. He believes that he is leading their secular country towards an Islamic state. I asked him if he wants the US to expedite Gulen and he was emphatic that we shouldn't because there is no proof he had anything to do with the attempted coup and he will be executed.

Whether you or I agree with them or not they have been generally negative about the actions of Ergodan.

The seats were tight and hard and the airport was awful. We flew on Turkish Airlines last time and they were wonderful!\\nIstanbul: We spent 3 days in Istanbul which was plenty of time to see all the major sites and have a Turkish Bath. I recommend Cembilitis! Because of the political situation there were virtually no crowds and most of the tourists were Turkish. Because of that it was really great experience and better than ever.\\nBergama: We flew from Istanbul to Edremit on Pegasus Airlines for approximately $35 a ticket. Then took a taxi to Bergama, a lovely town ---glad we went! There we stayed at the Acropolis Hotel for two nights. It was cheap and had a pool and only a short walk to town and the cable car that takes you to the ruins.Gold jewelry is a good buy here and you pay what the Turks pay:)\\nSelcuk: We took a taxi to Izmir. it is a large city that we had little interest in so we went directly to the bus station in took a luxury bus to Selcuk/Ephesus. In Selcuk we stayed at the Homeros Pensione. The rooms are all the rooms are decorated with Turkish antiques and the brother-sister hosts are wonderful. There is a large local market on Saturday morning not to be missed and a smaller one on Thursday! You can get great buys like traditional bamboo cotton blankets for a third of the price in town. Ephesus is only a short taxi ride from town and it's best to go in the morning or after 4 when it's not as hot. On this visit there were virtually no crowds and again mainly Turkish Tourists. We spent 3 days there.\\nPamukkale: To climb the calcite terraces, swim in the ancient pool and Europolis you can take a train or a bus to Pamukkale. We took a luxury bus,very nice, for the 3 hour ride and stayed the night at the Hotel Bellimaritino,very clean, modern with a pool and lovely hosts for only $25 a night!\\nFeythia: We took a long bus ride 4 plus hours to get here to take our 4 day Gulet Boat trip to Olympos. We went with V-Go Blue Cruises. The cost is only $299 for 4 days and 3 nights all meals! Great food. Lovely boat and captain and crew. You can go to there website for more info.\\nOlympos: We are staying here 2 nights. Olympos is kind of funky..little beach cabins. Good food. Don't miss the hike to the Eternal Flames at sunset! Very impressive but hot and hard. Wear suitable shoes and bring water.\\nCappadocia: We are taking a taxi to Antalya for a domestic flight to Cappadocia.Because we love it so we are staying here 5 nights this trip. We are staying again at the Panoramic Cave Hotel in a fairy cave room. Look at their website to see all the rooms. It costs more but getting up in the morning and seeing from the beautiful terrace the sky full of hot-air balloons over the fairy like town is worth it!

If your husband is with you, I would suggest he get a shave in Kusadasi which is a special experience. I would also suggest going to a Turkish bath. I think you will have an opportunity on the tour. We went for a swim in the pool at Pammukale which was awesome but this may not be an option in November. Also the hot air balloorn ride was a highlight of our tour. Have a great time!\", 'answer2': 'I really enjoyed Dolmabahce Palace. Make sure you tour the private \"family\" side as well as it was equally interesting. It was easy to reach with public transportation. I also went to the Basilica Cistern and highly recommend it. There\\'s not really a ton to do down there but I just found it to be so beautifully lit down there...I took tons of pictures. I also toured Suleymaniye Mosque. I think I did it in conjunction with a Chora Church tour and they were nice contrasts to each other. For that tour, I used a day tour company called Efendi Travel.', 'answer3': 'Loved the Archaeological Museum. The Rustem Pasha mosque is a small gem, around the corner from the Spice Market. Suleymaniye Mosque is another excellent choice.', 'answer4': \"*** This is a duplicate reply from another thread where you posted the same question ***\\nI had a long layover in Istanbul and just returned from there last night. I would highly recommend the Archeological Museum - it was my first time there and, unfortunately, the 2 hours I had in the morning did not do it justice but I had to catch my flight. It's comprised of 3 buildings (The Tiled Kiosk, The Museum of the Ancient Orient, and the main Museum) and it really deserves at least 3 hours, but more likely 4-5 if you're an archeology buff, you need time to read and digest the descriptions, or you want to relax a bit at the cafe. The highlights for me were the sarcophaghi, the Iznik tiles, and the Babylonian/ Assyrian treasures. Wonderful museum and very close to the main sites in the Old City, including the Cistern. Definitely set aside 3-5 hours or so for it, depending on your interest in the subject matter.\\nOn a different note, I would also highly recommend Dolmabahce Palace (gorgeous views and really stunning, over-the-top interior) as well but you should consider that it is fully-guided, timed-entry and you need to get there early so as not to stand in a long line (this may not be valid in November though). You'll need to take the tram there (it's easy) to the Tophane stop and walk a bit...it's along the Bosphorus to the north. So altogether, it will take you a half day at least with transport, tour, standing in line, and having some snacks in the cafe.\\nOne other really fun thing to do (and super relaxing) is just to take a local ferry to the Asia side and poke around. I went to Kadikoy and had a great time checking out food markets and eating some wonderful local food. Not many tourists there at all compared to Sultanahmet. The ride on the Bosphorus is 4 Lira and priceless! Definitely the top highlight of Istanbul - you can ride local ferries in either direction (Bosphorus or Golden Horn) - they don't need to be the tourist oriented ones, just the simple ferries that locals take to get back and forth. PM me for any questions - I've been to Istanbul multiple times on my own.\", 'answer5': \"Overall your ideas look pretty good. Here are my thoughts on them:\\nThe Basilica Cistern does not take long to see and is interesting.\\nThe Sulemaniye Mosque is well worth a visit. If you see this, you'll be somewhat close to the Grand Bazaar (the other site of Istanbul University) if you want to re-visit it.\\nThe Archaeological Museum is a top must-see site in my mind. This is right next to the Turkish and Islamic Arts museum which is also worth a visit.\\nDolmabahce Palace is a more European palace compared to the Topkopi, but is interesting.\\nSema Ceremony. I looked at the itinerary for the tour you're taking. You have a Sema/Dervish ceremony already scheduled on Day 6 of your tour when you are in Cappadocia. I am assuming this is at the Sarihan caravanserai near Avanos which is a really nifty venue. I think I'd pass on a repeat in Istanbul. The ceremony itself is interesting, but slow.\\nHere are a few other ideas:\\n- As noted earlier, the Rustem Pasa Mosque (near the spice bazaar) is an nifty little mosque that does not take long to visit.\\n- The Galata Tower will give you a nice view of the city.\\n- The Pera Museum has a nice art collection.\\nHave fun!\", 'title': 'Istanbul Pre and Post RS Tour'}.

I recommend that you see if first so you don't miss it .\\nBlue Mosque: across the street from the Aya Sophia, 20 to 30 minutes. Pay attention to the time of day. It will be closed for about 30 minutes during the five daily prayer times.\\nArasta bazaar: a small bazaar next to the Blue Mosque. It's nothing like the Grand Bazaar, but will give you a flavor. 20 minutes to walk through, longer if you want to shop\\nTopkapi Palace: 2 hours - You would be hard pressed to see this site alone in 3 to 4 hours.

The Blue Mosque is free and gorgeous to look around and photograph.
